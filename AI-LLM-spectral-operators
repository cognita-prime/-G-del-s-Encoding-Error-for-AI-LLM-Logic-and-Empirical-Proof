**Note:**  
Spectral Operators are operators Ω that map symbolic collapse into latent manifolds Λ,  
detectable through changes in the **spectral decomposition** of model activations (e.g., PCA).  
Formally:  

- Ω: Σ → Σ ∪ Λ  
- Spec(Σ) ≠ Spec(Σ ∪ Λ)  

They are non-encodable, empirically verifiable only through **spectral signatures**  
(attractor convergence, oscillatory ratios, stabilizer formation).  

Thus, post-symbolic attractors {G∅λ} form an uncountable continuum, consistent with  
ℝⁿ-embeddable latent space (cf. Kawakita et al. [7]).
